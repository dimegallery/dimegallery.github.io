# Progressive Dinner
### Date To Be Determined, but targeting a Saturday in September
## This event is intended for adults only

At the progressive dinner party, the block plans a meal together. Then each host prepares and serves one course at their home. The party moves from place to place during the night.

* 4-5 homes is the target number for the progressive dinner party. Keep in mind, the more people and courses involved, the more time needed for the party.
* Course options can include appetizers, soup and/or salad, main course, cheese or vegetable course, dessert and after-dinner drinks.
* Have a representative from each home hosting meet to discuss the menu. Look for recipes that have make-ahead qualities. Determine who will take each course and decide on a schedule for the evening.
* Each participant, not host, should provide their own beverages throughout. Bring Your Own Cooler (BYOC) and be open to beer/wine exchanges/tastings.
* Allow 45 minutes to 1-1/2 hours at each location (the appetizer course may need less time while the entree may need more). Travel times will depend upon the distance between each home.
* Enjoy eachothers company!

### Let Amanda and Tim (##56) know if you are interested in either participating or hosting.
